Web Studio - Responsive Design 

Welcome to the last phase of the Web Studio project! At this stage, the adaptive layout has been successfully implemented for all elements of the main page, ensuring a smooth appearance and optimal functionality on various screen sizes and devices. Here are the specific details of this stage:

Project Content

Responsive Design
Regardless of the device used to access the site, as long as the screen width is 320px or more, the horizontal scrollbar does not appear, guaranteeing a smooth browsing experience for the user.
The script for the mobile menu is included in the HTML file, via a separate file called mobile-menu.js.

Mobile Menu script
The mobile menu functionality is implemented by the script in the mobile-menu.js file.
A complete example for creating a mobile menu using this script can be accessed via the link provided.

HTML tags
All pages in the project include a viewport meta tag in the <head> section, ensuring proper scaling on different devices.
Background images and graphic content are responsive, supporting both standard and high-density screens (x1 and x2).
For responsive background images, media features such as min-device-pixel-ratio and min-resolution are used correctly.
The mobile menu is made entirely by HTML tags.

stylization
The Mobile First approach is followed in the styling process, using media features such as min-width.
Styles are defined only in certain width ranges, enclosed in media queries, using min-width and max-width conditions.
There is no unnecessary duplication of styles inside media queries.
The layout is designed with three breakpoints in mind: 480px, 768px and 1200px.
The styling of the mobile menu is complete, providing an intuitive and aesthetic browsing experience on small screens.

Conclusion
With the completion of the responsive homepage layout, the Web Studio project is now ready to provide a seamless and user-friendly experience on a wide range of devices, from small smartphones to large desktop screens. The Mobile First approach ensures that the design is optimized for mobile devices, while media queries allow for specific stylistic adjustments as the screen width increases.
